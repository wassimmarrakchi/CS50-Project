Welcome to ProcrastAnki, the extension that's meant to make your procrastination fruitful and well deserved!

We've all taken a language class or any other class really with a lot of words and definitions to memorize. Don't let synonyms, capitals, or scientific words for mundane things get you ever again!

To start procrastinating right, follow these simple steps:
Step 0: Open your google chrome browser
Step 1: Navigate to your extensions (`chrome://extensions/`)
Step 2: Check the box next to 'Developer Tools'
Step 3: Click 'Load unpacked extension'
Step 4: Select the folder 'Procrastanki'
Step 3: Make some flashcards and input some distracting websites to start Procrastankinating (We know we're pushing it)

ProcrastAnki is 100% customizable! Your ideal procrastination experience is at your fingertips. We believe that no one knows your habits better than you. You decide what's best for you and for your procrastination.

Overview of the different functionalities you have access to:

- Block website: You can block a website by either typing its "hostname" (ie: wikipedia, google, facebook...) and clicking on the keyboard key `return`/`Enter` or the button `Block`.
- Block current page: You can block a certain url by opening it in your tab and clicking on `Block Current Page`.
- Add flashcard: You can add a flashcard by typing its front (the prompt you will be given) in the `Front flashcard` textbox, typing its back (words you will have to guess) in the `Back flashcard` textbox and clicking on the keyboard key `return`/`Enter` or the button `Make Flashcard`.
- Unblock website: You can unblock a website previously blocked by selecting it from the dropdownmenu and clicking on the keyboard key `return`/`Enter` or the button `Unblock website`.
- Unblock all websites: You can unblock all websites previously blocked by clicking on the button `Unblock all websites`.
- Delete flashcard: You can delete a flashcard previously made by selecting it from the dropdownmenu and clicking on the keyboard key `return`/`Enter` or the button `Delete Flashcard`.
- Delete all flashcards: You can delete all flashcards previously made by clicking on the button `Delete All Flashcards`.
- Set block time in minutes: The block time is the procrastination time you allow yourself before blocking all websites again. By default, the block time is set to be 15 seconds. To change it, type in the block time you want in minutes in the textbox in front of `Set block time in mins:` and click on the keyboard key `return`/`Enter` or the button `Set`.
- Set flashcards to unlock: To unlock your previously blocked websites, you have to do a certain number of flashcards. By default, this number is set to be 10 flashcards (if you have made at least 10 flashcards). To change this, type in the number of flashcards you want in the textbox in front of `Set # flashcards to unlock:` and click on the keyboard key `return`/`Enter` or the button `Set`.
- Reinitialize: If your ProcrastAnki is failing you (we're not perfect), click on `Reinitialize` and your ProcrastAnki will be reset.

To remove ProcrastAnki from your chrome browser (We're not sure why you ever would), do one of the following:
Option 1: Right click on our fancy icon to the right of the url bar and select 'Remove from Chrome...'
Option 2: Navigate back to your chrome extensions and click the little trash icon to the right of ProcrastAnki


Now that you understand all the tools offered to you by ProcrastAnki, go and procrastinate right!
